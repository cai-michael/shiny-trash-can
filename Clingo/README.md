# Clingo

## Notes on Running these Programs
Personally I just go and install the Clingo standalone executable from Sourceforge. See the downloads section on the Potassco website (https://potassco.org/clingo/).
## Puzzles
Random puzzles, more explanations inside the README in that folder.

## Sudoku
Some solutions to a few textbook problems regarding variants of Sudoku, they are all implemented in Clingo with examples.
