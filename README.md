This repository is a variety of projects I've worked on with no real connection

## Peg-Board-Game 
My honors contract for CSE110: Principles of Programming, It's just the Triangle Peg Game you can find in Cracker Barrels written in Java.
This game was my first independent programming project done during my freshman year of college. I hard coded all of the valid movements and meticulously commented on most lines.

## Connect-Four
My honors contract for CSE205: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, It's the classic vertical four-in-a-row game.
Our class had just started to work with GUI based projects, so I decided to make a game. The project is implemented in Java and uses the Java Swing toolkit for the GUI elements.
